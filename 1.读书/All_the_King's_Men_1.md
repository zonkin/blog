1. "No," the Boss corrected,"I'm not a lawyer.I know some law.In fact,I know a lot of law.And I made me some money out of law.It's like a single-bed blanket on a double bed and three folks in the bed and a cold night.There ain't ever enough blanket to cover the case,no matter how much pulling and hauling,and somebody is always going to nigh catch pneumonia.Hell, the law is like the pants you bought last year for a growing boy,but it is always this year and the seams are popped and the shankbone's to the breeze.The law is always too short and too tight for growing humankind.The best you can do something and then make up some law to fit and by the time that the law gets on the books you would have done something different.Do you think half the things I've done were clear,distinct,and simple in the consitution of this state?"

2. "He's insterested in Willie.Quite simply and directly.And when anybody is interested in himself quite simple and directly the way Willie is interested in Willie you call it genius.It's only the half-baked people like Mr. Patton who are interested in money.Even the big boys who make a real lot of money aren't interested in money.Henry Ford isn't interested in money.He's interested in Henry Ford and threefore he is a genius."

3. There wasn't a sound for half a minute.Mr. Patton's granite visage seemed to lean toward me like a monument about to fall,and the satchel under Mrs. Patton's chin quivered like a tow sack full of kittens,and the Judge just sat, with his yellow eyes working over the crowd,and my mother's hands turned in he lap.

4. It was always the same way when I came home and saw my mother.I would be surprised that it was the way it was but I knew at the same that I had she didn't really care a thing about me,that I was just another man whom she wantted to have men around and had to make them dance to her tune. But as soon as I saw he I would forget all that.Sometimes I forgot it even before I saw her.Anyway when I forot it,I would wonder why we couldn't get along.I would wonder even though I knew what would happen,even though I would always know that the scene into which I was about to step and in which I was about to step and in which I was about to say the words I would say,had happened before, or had never stopped happening,and that I would always just be entering the wide,white,high-ceilinged hall to see across the distance of the floor,which gleamed like dark ice,my mother,who stood in a doorway,beyond her the flicker of firelight in the shadowy room,and smiled at me with a sudden and innocent happiness,like a girl.
  Then she would come toward me,with a brittle,excited clatter of heels and a quick,throaty laugh,and stop before me and seize a little bunch of each hand,in a way that was childlike and both weak and demanding,and lift her face up to me,turning it somewhat to one side so that I could put the expected kiss upon her cheek.The texture of her cheek would be firm and smooth,quite cool,and I would breathe the scent which she always used,and as I kissed her I would see the plucked accuracy of the eyebrow,the delicate lines at the corner of the eye toward me,and note the crinkled,shadowed texture of the eyelid,which would flicker sharply over the blue eye.The eye,very slightly protruding,would be fixed glitteringly on some point beyond me.

5. I don't know whether Willie meant to do it.But anyway,he did it.He didn't exactly shove Duffy off the platform.He just started Duffy doing a dance along the edge,a kind of delicate,feather-toed,bemused,slow-motion adagio accompanied by arms pinwheeling around a face which was like a surprised custard pie with a hole scooped in the middle of the meringue,and the hole was Duffy's mouth,but no sound came out of it.There wasn't a sound over that five-acre tract of sweating humanity.They just watched Duffy do his dance.

6. I walked over to the bed and inspected the item.It was lying on its back.The coat was pushed up under the armpits,the hands were crossed piously on the bosom like the hands of a gisant on a tomb in a cathedral,the shirt had pulled up some from its moorings under the belt and the two lowest buttons had come unbuttoned so that a triangular patch of slightly distended stomach was visible‚Äî‚Äîwhite,with a few coarse dark hairs.The mouth was parted a little,and the lower lip vibrated with a delicate flabbiness at each measured expulsion of breath.All very pretty.
